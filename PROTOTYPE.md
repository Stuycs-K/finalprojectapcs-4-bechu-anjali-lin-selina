(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include: 
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

Candy class contains all information specific to each candy.
+ All information is private, accessible only through get methods
+ Only the special variable can be changed (indicates if the candy is a special candy and the kind)

Board class contains all methods used to manipulate the game board.
+ Returns booleans for if actions are performed

Tracker class contains all game information.
+ Keeps all the game-related data private, can only be seen through get methods

In main will be the setup and drawing, as well as getting points on the board.
+ Draws the board and updates changes made
+ Detects where the player has clicked and translates it to coordinates on the board
+ Displays Win and Lose screens
