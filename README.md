Brief Project description 
It would be one level of candy crush with a goal of reaching 3000 points given 30 moves. It would be a standard 9x9 board that is randomized each time the program is run. There would be a scoreboard to the side with every 3 candies matched yielding 50 points. There will be special candies---striped and wrapped---acting as they would in the actual candy crush game.
- After 1.5 weeks we think we need to have the actual board with the randomized candies, we should have the matching method written (at least for regular candies), and be able to display the number of moves the player has left along with the scoreboard
- We were discussing recording the player's high score so that might be nice to have if we decide to implement


# Intended usage:

The player would be able to swap candies to make matches. New candies would respawn when the others disappear (it is undecided whether we are making the candies fall down). With each match made the scoreboard will be updated to reflect that and the special candies will work as they do in the actual game when the player uses them in a match.
