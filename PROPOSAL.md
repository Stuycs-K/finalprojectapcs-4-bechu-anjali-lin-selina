# Final Project Proposal

# IDEAS:

### Candy Crush
It would be one level with a simple goal.
- ie to take out a certain number of blue candies

We would need to create a randomized board for each time the program is run and the candies would need to regenerate as matches are made.
- We haven't decided what size we wanted to make the board

We would need to record the score.
- The number of points a match will yield is still undecided.

We will be recreating the special candies in candy crush.

And instead of only swiping up, down, left and right we might allow the player to swap the positions of candies.
