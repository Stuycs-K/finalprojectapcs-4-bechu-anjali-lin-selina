Anjali Bechu and Selina Lin

# IDEAS:

### Candy Crush
It would be one level with a simple goal.
- A possible goal is to take out a certain number of blue candies (the number is undecided as of now)

Creates a randomized board for each time the program is run and the candies would regenerate as matches are made.
- We haven't decided what size we wanted to make the board

The score will be recorded.
- The number of points a match will yield is still undecided.

The special candies from Candy Crush will be recreated.
- The striped, wrapped, etc

Instead of only swiping up, down, left and right we **might** allow the player to swap the positions of candies.


### Checkers
It would be a one player version.
- Alternates between the player moving and a random piece of the other color being moved.

It would be a pretty standard checkers board. The pieces would be used in the fashion as the real game.
- A regular piece can only move forward and once it reaches the other end, it can begin to move backwards


### Battleship
It would be a one player version.
- Alternates between the player attacking and a random spot on the playerâ€™s board being attacked.

Both boards will be displayed on the screen.
- One is random and has the ships hidden from the player and the other has visible ships placed by the player.
- Size of board and number and size of pieces still undecided.
- Misses and hits, as well as any sunken ships, will be updated on the board.
