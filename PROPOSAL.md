# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Anjali Bechu and Selina Lin

# IDEAS:

### Candy Crush
It would be one level with a simple goal.
- A possible goal is to take out a certain number of blue candies (the number is undecided as of now)

We would need to create a randomized board for each time the program is run and the candies would need to regenerate as matches are made.
- We haven't decided what size we wanted to make the board

We would need to record the score.
- The number of points a match will yield is still undecided.

We will be recreating the special candies from Candy Crush.
- The striped, wrapped, etc

And instead of only swiping up, down, left and right we **might** allow the player to swap the positions of candies.


### Checkers
It would be a pretty standard checkers board. The pieces would be used in the fashion as the real game.
- A regular piece can only move forward and once it reaches the other end, it can begin to move backwards


### Battleship
It would be a one player version. Both boards will be displayed on the screen. 
- One is random and has the ships hidden from the player and the other has visible ships placed by the player.
- Size of board and number and size of pieces still undecided.

Alternates between the player attacking and a random spot on the playerâ€™s board being attacked.
- Misses and hits, as well as any sunken ships, will be updated on the board.
